# BIA Astro prototype implementation

This repository, **bijux-bia-astro**, is Bijux's proposal fork of
[BioImage-Archive/BIA-astro](https://github.com/BioImage-Archive/BIA-astro).
It preserves the BioImage Archive application identity and public interfaces.
Changes are prepared for team review before proposing focused pull requests upstream.

See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the fork workflow and
[engineering change reports](reports/README.md) for commit evidence.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run local`           | Equivalent to build && preview                   |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

Note that:
`npm run dev` will update as you change things but may give a false impression of the final result, whereas running `npm run build` and then `npm run preview` will recreate what netlify runs, and will provide an accurate display of the website.


## Run linkchecker locally

Prerequisites
* install linkchecker: https://linkchecker.github.io/linkchecker/install.html

To test:
* build and preview locally: `npm run local`
* run: `linkchecker http://localhost:4321/bioimage-archive/ -o failures --no-warnings --ignore-url '.*\/vis\/?.*' --ignore-url '.*\/dataset\/?.*' --ignore-url '.*\/sodataset\/?.*' --ignore-url '.*\/aidataset\/?.*'` *

\* Note that on mac you may have to modify permissions of the /Users/$USER/.config/linkchecker to get this command to work.

You can also run this on the files genated by the build by running `npm run build` and then `linkchecker dist/bioimage-archive/ ...`


## Verify local OME-Zarr display

When the frontend is configured for a local search API whose image records
refer to loopback MinIO, verify both parts of the local viewer path:

1. Open the Study page and confirm its selected hero image links to the
   corresponding Image page when the URI matches `image_static_display_uri`.
2. Open that Image page and confirm the embedded Vizarr viewer can read the
   local OME-Zarr source.

The standard Image page delegates the browser's loopback/private-network
permissions to the Vizarr iframe. Gallery-specific viewers are separate entry
points and are not covered by this check.


## Style guide

We follow: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/JavaScript 
- Classes are PascalCase, which include any imported astro templates/files
- variables, objects, and functions are camelCase
Note that for astro, pages with dynamic route parameters should therefore be called `[camelCaseParameter].astro`
